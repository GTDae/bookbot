# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

Bookbot is a Python command-line programme designed to analyse text files and generate a statistical report. It's a simple, yet effective, tool for understanding the composition of a book or any other text. ðŸ“š

This programme was developed as a guided project from Boot.Dev.

Features
Word Count: Counts the total number of words in a text file.

Character Frequency: Determines the number of times each alphabetical character appears in the text, ignoring case.

Formatted Report: Prints a clean, easy-to-read report that lists characters from most frequent to least frequent.

Command-Line Arguments: Accepts a file path as an argument, so you can analyse any text file you choose.

How to Use
To use Bookbot, simply run the main.py file from your terminal and provide the path to the book you want to analyse.

python3 main.py books/frankenstein.txt
If you don't provide a file path, the programme will display a usage message to help you.

Technologies Used
